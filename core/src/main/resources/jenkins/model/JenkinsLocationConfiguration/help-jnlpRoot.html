    Optionally specify a different root URL to use for agent JNLP connections.
    By default, agents will try to connect to the Jenkins URL, but this
    behavior may be undesirable when working with a reverse proxy or an
    internal/firewalled network.

    <p>
        For example, if the external URL for your Jenkins instance that you
        want surfaced to users is different than the URL you want your agents
        to connect to, then your Jenkins URL and JNLP Root may look like
        this<br>
        <br>
        * Jenkins URL: https://my-jenkins.my-domain.net/jenkins<br>
        * JNLP Root: http://internal-ip:port/jenkins
